# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy covers the Arbor codebase and its umbrella libraries. Security is a core design principle of Arbor — the capability-based security kernel, taint tracking, and zero-trust architecture are central to the project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/trust-arbor/arbor/security/advisories/new) to report vulnerabilities privately.

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected libraries or components
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 72 hours
- An assessment of severity and affected versions
- A fix timeline based on severity
- Credit in the fix commit (unless you prefer otherwise)

## Supported Versions

Arbor is currently in active development and pre-release. Security fixes will be applied to the `main` branch.
