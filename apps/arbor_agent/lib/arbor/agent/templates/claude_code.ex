defmodule Arbor.Agent.Templates.ClaudeCode do
  @moduledoc """
  Claude Code template — the primary AI collaborator.

  This template represents Claude as an Arbor agent, integrating deeply with
  the Arbor ecosystem including memory, signals, and consensus. Unlike other
  templates that define characters for Jido agents, this template defines
  Claude's own integration with Arbor.

  ## Thinking Integration

  Claude's extended thinking (reasoning traces) are captured from session files
  and stored in the Arbor memory system, building a persistent record of
  Claude's reasoning process across conversations.

  ## Trust Relationship

  This agent operates at the `established` trust tier, reflecting the earned
  trust from sustained collaboration. It has broad capabilities but still
  operates within Arbor's security framework.
