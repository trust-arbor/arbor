# CLAUDE.md

Arbor is a distributed AI agent orchestration system built on Elixir/OTP. Umbrella project with capability-based security and contract-first design.

## Library Hierarchy

```
Level 0: arbor_contracts, arbor_common (zero in-umbrella deps)
Level 1: signals, shell, security, consensus, historian, persistence, web, sandbox (depend on Level 0)
Level 2: trust, actions, agent, bridge (depend on Level 0–1)
Standalone: checkpoint, eval (zero in-umbrella deps)
```

No cycles. No skipping levels. Check each library's `mix.exs` for exact deps.

## Key Patterns

- **Contract-First**: Shared types and behaviours in `arbor_contracts`. Read [CONTRACT_RULES.md](docs/arbor/CONTRACT_RULES.md) before modifying contracts.
- **Facade Pattern**: Each library exposes one public facade (e.g., `Arbor.Security`). Never alias internal modules from another library.
- Search existing facades before writing new code. Expand a facade rather than reaching into internals.

## Architecture Triggers

**STOP and brainstorm** (create `.arbor/roadmap/0-inbox/` item if unclear):

| Trigger | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| **Importing an internal module from another library** | Use the public facade. Expand it if needed. |
| **Facade doesn't have what you need** | Propose expanding it, or use behaviour injection ([CONTRACT_RULES.md §9](docs/arbor/CONTRACT_RULES.md)). |
| **Adding a dependency between libraries** | Must follow hierarchy. Cycles or skipped layers = wrong design. |
| **Hardcoding a module name for cross-library calls** | Use the library's `Config` module ([CONTRACT_RULES.md §8-9](docs/arbor/CONTRACT_RULES.md)). |
| **Duplicating logic from another library** | That library should expose it via its facade. |
| **Creating or modifying contracts** | Read [CONTRACT_RULES.md](docs/arbor/CONTRACT_RULES.md) first. |

## Custom Aliases

```bash
mix quality    # format --check-formatted + credo --strict
mix test.fast  # unit tests only (--only fast)
```

## Test Tagging

Use consistent tags for test categorization. See [TEST_TAGGING.md](docs/arbor/TEST_TAGGING.md) for full guidelines.

Quick reference:
- `:fast` / `:slow` — speed
- `:integration` — crosses boundaries
- `:database`, `:external`, `:llm` — external dependencies

## Edit Tool Pitfalls

**Always search for all occurrences before using `replace_all: true`.** The string may appear in alias declarations, comments, or other contexts where replacement breaks things.

## Roadmap

Ideas and work items go in `.arbor/roadmap/` (`0-inbox/` → `1-brainstorming/` → `2-planned/` → `3-in-progress/` → `5-completed/`). Design decisions go in `.arbor/decisions/`.
